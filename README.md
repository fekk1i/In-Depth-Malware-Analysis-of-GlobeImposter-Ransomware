# In-Depth Malware Analysis of GlobeImposter Ransomware

This project documents the analysis and reverse engineering of the GlobeImposter ransomware variant. The focus is on understanding the malware's structure, behavior, and the techniques it employs for persistence, evasion, and impact on infected systems.

## Project Overview:
GlobeImposter is a ransomware variant that encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption. This report covers both static and dynamic analysis, exploring the ransomware's interactions with the system, network activity, and anti-debugging measures.

## Methodology:
- **Basic Static Analysis**: Initial examination of file information, code structure, and string analysis.
- **Basic Dynamic Analysis**: Running the malware in a controlled virtual environment to observe its runtime behavior, including network communication and registry modifications.
- **Advanced Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Detailed reverse engineering using **x32dbg** and **IDA Pro** to unpack and analyze the malwareâ€™s code and behavior.
  
## Tools Used:
- **PEStudio**: For initial static analysis.
- **x32dbg**: Debugger used to reverse engineer the packed malware and locate the Original Entry Point (OEP).
- **IDA Pro**: Used for further analysis of the unpacked executable.
- **Scylla Plugin**: For rebuilding the Import Address Table (IAT) and repairing the unpacked file.
- **Wireshark**: To monitor network activity generated by the malware.

## Key Findings:
1. **File System Activities**:
   - The malware accessed and modified critical system files such as `AUTOEXEC.BAT` and `CONFIG.SYS`.
   - It delivered its payload by copying malicious files to the Windows startup folder, ensuring persistence.
2. **Network Behavior**:
   - Exhibited connections to multiple IP addresses and domains, using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communication.
   - Displayed behavior characteristic of data exfiltration and command-and-control activities.
3. **Evasion Techniques**:
   - Implemented anti-debugging measures, such as OutputDebugString and manipulation of memory protections via VirtualProtect API calls.
   - Deleted system cache files to prevent forensic analysis.
4. **Manual Unpacking**:
   - Identified the packed nature of the executable via high entropy values.
   - Unpacked the malware using x32dbg and Scylla plugin, allowing for further analysis of its functionality post-unpacking.

## Results:
The analysis successfully unpacked and reverse-engineered the ransomware, providing insights into its structure and behavior. The malware used multiple evasion techniques, ensured persistence, and communicated with external servers for command and control. The analysis revealed critical points for implementing security countermeasures.

## Conclusion:
This analysis of GlobeImposter ransomware highlights the sophistication of modern ransomware, including its obfuscation and evasion strategies. Understanding these techniques is vital for improving security defenses and developing more effective detection methods.
